# Hartford-Policing-Graphic

For this graphic, I used data from the Stanford Open Policing Project. Through data analysis, I identified the officer with the most arrest in the five year period provided in Hartford, Connecticut. I then took all of his arrest, and used the longitude and latitude provided to map all of his arrests on a map of the city.
